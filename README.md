### Project Setup

To run any of the code snippets from the CodeChallange-JavaScript repository, you can follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/valdez91/CodeChallange-JavaScript.git
2.  Change directory into the repository:
    cd CodeChallange-JavaScript
3.  Navigate to the directory of the project you want to run:

    cd Project1 # for Project1: Grade Generator

    cd Project2 # for Project2: speed-Detector

    cd Project3 # for Project3: Net-Salary-Calculator

4.  Open the project in your preferred text editor or IDE.

5.  Compile and run the code as needed.

Note that these steps are general and may vary depending on your specific setup and preferences.

### Running code using inde.html file.

1.Open the "inde.html" file in a web browser.

2.If the file is located in the same directory as the other project files, you can simply open it in your browser.

3.Once the file is opened, you should see a user interface with a form or prompt that allows you to enter the necessary information.

4.Once you've entered the required information, click the "Submit" button or press enter to run the code.

5.The output should be displayed on the page

## Project1: Grade Generator.

A simple JavaScript program that takes in a student's grades and calculates their final grade.

### Description

This program uses JavaScript's prompt() function to ask the user to enter their grades, and then calculates their final grade based on the following criteria:

A: 90% and above

B: 80% to 89%

C: 70% to 79%

D: 60% to 69%

E: Below 60%

The program then displays the final grade to the user.

## Project2: speed-Detector.

### Description

This program takes a speed as an argument and determines whether a driver should receive a ticket or not. If the speed is less than 70 mph, a warning is printed. If the speed is greater than or equal to 70 mph, the program calculates the points and prints a message. The points are calculated as follows: 1 point per 5 mph over 70 mph. If the driver gets more than 12 points, their license is suspended.

## Project3: Net-Salary-Calculator

A simple JavaScript program that takes in the user's gross salary and deductions, and calculates their net salary.

### Description

The code contains several functions that are used to calculate different taxes and deductions, such as KRA tax, NHIF tax, NSSF tax, gross salary, and net salary. The functions are well-named and well-structured, making it easy to understand what they do and how they are used.

The main function calls the other functions to calculate the net salary, and then displays the result on the screen. This makes it easy to understand how the overall calculation is performed.

Overall, the code is well-structured, well-documented, and follows best practices, making it a good example of how to write, maintain and readable code.

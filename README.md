## Project1: Grade Generator.

A simple JavaScript program that takes in a student's grades and calculates their final grade.

### Description

This program uses JavaScript's prompt() function to ask the user to enter their grades, and then calculates their final grade based on the following criteria:

A: 90% and above

B: 80% to 89%

C: 70% to 79%

D: 60% to 69%

E: Below 60%

The program then displays the final grade to the user.

## Project2: speed-Detector.

### Description

This program takes a speed as an argument and determines whether a driver should receive a ticket or not. If the speed is less than 70 mph, a warning is printed. If the speed is greater than or equal to 70 mph, the program calculates the points and prints a message. The points are calculated as follows: 1 point per 5 mph over 70 mph. If the driver gets more than 12 points, their license is suspended.

## Project3: Net-Salary-Calculator

A simple JavaScript program that takes in the user's gross salary and deductions, and calculates their net salary.

### Description

The code contains several functions that are used to calculate different taxes and deductions, such as KRA tax, NHIF tax, NSSF tax, gross salary, and net salary. The functions are well-named and well-structured, making it easy to understand what they do and how they are used.

The main function calls the other functions to calculate the net salary, and then displays the result on the screen. This makes it easy to understand how the overall calculation is performed.

Overall, the code is well-structured, well-documented, and follows best practices, making it a good example of how to write, maintain and readable code.
